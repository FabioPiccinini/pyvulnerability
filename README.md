# pyvulnerability
This project aims to automate the evaluation of certain geometric parameters related to buildings that are often used, together with other input parameters, to perform expeditive seismic vulnerability assessments.

These parameters are:
- number of floors of each building;
- shape regularity in plan;
- planimetric position of the building in relation to the cluster;
- presence of adjacent buildings with different heights in the cluster, in relation to the examined building.

This is done in the QGIS environment using the following input data:
- polygon vectorial layer of building footprints;
- Digital Terrain Model (DTM) raster;
- Digital Surface Model (DSM) raster.


QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS

1) Download the zip of the code.
2) Extract the folder from the zip and rename it as "pyvulnerability" (without the branch suffix).
3) Place the "pyvulnerability" folder into your QGIS project folder (where your qgz or qgs file is saved).
4) Open your QGIS project and open the property window of the polygonal layer representing the buildings in your QGIS project.
5) Using the "Load Style" command, load the actions from the "pyvulnerability buildings actions.qml" file from the "styles" subfolder.


ACTIONS

Setup:
To start using the script functions, use this action from the attribute table of your buildings layer, with the editing active.
It will generate the required fields and variables for the layer.

Field Info:
In the attribute table of your buildings layer, right click on one field of one element and select "Field Info".
A message window will pop up with a description of the field and the info about the availability of the "Field Auto Fill" actions.

Field Auto Fill:
Select the features of the desired buildings, right click on the desired field of one of this features in the attribute table and select "Field Auto Fill" to automatically compile the field for the selected features.

Field Auto Fill All:
Right click on the desired field of one of the buildings features in the attribute table and select "Field Auto Fill All" to automatically compile the field for all the features.


USE OF THE LAYER VARIABLES

Change the variables' value if you want to assign names different from the default ones to the buildings' fields or to the DTM and DSM layers.
