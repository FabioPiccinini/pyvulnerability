# pyvulnerability
This project aims to automate the evaluation of certain geometric parameters related to buildings that are often used, together with other input parameters, to perform expeditive seismic vulnerability assessments.

These parameters are:
- number of floors of each building;
-	shape regularity in plan;
-	planimetric position of the building in relation to the cluster;
-	presence of adjacent buildings with different heights in the cluster, in relation to the examined building.

This is done in the QGIS environment using the following input data:
- polygon vectorial layer of building footprints;
- Digital Terrain Model (DTM) raster;
- Digital Surface Model (DSM) raster.

NB: The repository is currently empty, the files will be uploaded soon after a small code cleaning phase to remove unnecessary parts that cannot be shared.
